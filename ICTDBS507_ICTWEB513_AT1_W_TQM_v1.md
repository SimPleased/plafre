Your teacher will play the role of your manager and the client, you will be required to communicate with your teacher to discuss aspects of the project.

## **Task 1 – Determine applicable legislative standards for business requirements**

*Identify at least 4 requirements of the website that have applicable legislative standards, identify the applicable standards, include a link/reference, and briefly explain how the standards apply.*

| Business Requirement | Legislative Standards | Application of Standards |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| The website must ensure accessibility for all users including those with disabilities. | Disability Discrimination Act 1992 [https://www.legislation.gov.au/details/C2018C00125](https://www.legislation.gov.au/details/C2018C00125)  | The website will use high contrast colours and scalable text to ensure readability for visually impaired users. |
| User data such as emails and passwords must be collected and stored securely. | Privacy Act 1988 [https://www.legislation.gov.au/details/C2021C00139](https://www.legislation.gov.au/details/C2021C00139)  | All personal user information is stored securely with encryption and will provide a clear privacy policy. |

| Create a blog post | As a member I want to create a blog post, so that I can share my thoughts with the gym community. | A form to write and submit a new post. |
|  | As an admin I want to create a blog post, so that members know of any important gym information. | A comprehensive form for creating and managing posts. |
| Delete Own Blog Posts | As a member I want to delete my own posts, so that I can remove content I no longer want visible. | A delete button on posts owned by the member. |
| View Session Timetable | As a user I want to view the session timetable, so that I can see all available classes and times. | A calendar view displaying scheduled gym sessions. |

*\<Add more rows as needed\>*

## **Task 3 – Produce design specification**

*In this task you will produce a design specification based on the requirements and functionality you established in the previous tasks.*

### **Task 3.1 \- Created a hierarchical sitemap diagram showing a suitable navigation structure for the website/webapp**

*Create a hierarchical sitemap diagram that shows a suitable navigation structure for the website/webapp according to the requirements. The diagram must comply with any provided organisational standards and/or procedures.*

| ![][image1] |
| :---: |

**Task 3.2 \- Explained how they ensured the logical organisation of the content so that it is accessible to the user.** 

*Review the navigation structure to ensure that content is logically organised and accessible to users in accordance with the project requirements. Explain how you confirmed that content is logically organised and accessible.*

| The sitemap groups pages based on user roles, creating a clear and intuitive structure for all visitors. Authenticated members can easily access their personal dashboard, while administrators have a separate section for management tasks. This organisation ensures users find relevant content quickly, improving the overall accessibility and usability of the website. |
| :---- |

**Task 3.3 \- Established and explained 3 design principles that will guide the design of the website user interface.**

*Establish at least 3 design principles that you will apply while developing the prototype of the user interface design. Provide an explanation of each.*

| *class note: [https://elementor.com/blog/principles-of-website-design/](https://elementor.com/blog/principles-of-website-design/) use 3 of these inside this blog* Visual Hierarchy will be used to guide user attention to the most important elements on each page. This principle helps users navigate content logically, and it makes key actions like booking a session very obvious. |
| :---- |
| Consistency in the design will ensure that all pages share a similar layout, with consistent fonts and colours. This approach creates a predictable user experience, which makes the website much easier to learn and navigate. |
| Simplicity will be a core principle, ensuring every screen is clean and free of unnecessary clutter. A simple interface allows users to complete their desired tasks efficiently, without any confusion or unwanted distractions. |

**Task 3.4 \- Produced high-fidelity a prototype that closely resembles the final website user interface. All pages and feature required by the brief must be included. Image and PDF export provided in submission.** 

*Produce a prototype of the user interface using industry standard tools. The prototype **must** include all interface elements and pages/screens and **must** have a look and feel that will very closely resemble the final project implementation. Provide an overview of image of the prototype below **and** attached PDF export of the complete prototype with your submission.*

| *\<prototype overview image\>* |

## **Task 4 – Determine and document architectural and data requirements**

*Based on the project requirements and design specification, determine and document a technical outline of the project, including the requirements for hosting, client devices, data, implementation, and database integration. Please remove the \<hint\> text from each cell as you complete the table.*

*It is expected that you provide **precise, formal, complete** and **technical** information and descriptions in your answers. All sections must be completed. Write as much information as necessary inside each cell*

| Task 4.1 \- Hosting Requirements |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Hardware specifications | *\<Research and outline the hardware specifications of a suitable server (both in-house and cloud are suitable options). Include details such as processor, memory, storage, network interface, etc\>* |
| Operating system | *\<Research and outline a suitable operating system to run the web application. The selected operating system must be compatible with the selected hardware platform\>* |
| Web server software | *\<Determine and outline a suitable webserver solution for the project\>* |
| **Task 4.2 \- Client Device Requirements** |  |
| Target devices / operating systems | *\<Provide an outline of the target device formfactors and systems the site will target\>*  |
| Target web browsers | *\<Identify the browsers (include version) that the site will target\>*  |
| **Task 4.3 \- Data Requirements** |  |
| Database Management System | *\<Research and outline the differences between SQL and NoSQL database\> \<Determine why SQL is better suited to this project and the SQL vendor/solution you will use\>* SQL databases enforce a strict schema for relational data, which is different from flexible NoSQL databases like MongoDB. We will use MySQL because the project data is highly relational, as shown in the provided entity relationship diagram. |
| Database technical upgrades | *\<Determine DBMS and/or adapter versions and upgrades needed to fulfil the project requirements and integrate the DBMS with the project implementation\>* |
| Data storage requirements | *\<Determine and outline scalability and capacity requirements\>* |
| User input data | *\<Determine the format and validation rules **for all** user input data\>* |
| **Task 4.4 \- Implementation Requirements** |  |
| Programming languages | *\<Determine and outline suitable language(s) for the project\>* JavaScript will be the primary programming language for both the frontend and the backend of the application. We will also use SQL to interact directly with the MySQL database when it is necessary. |
| Frameworks and libraries | *\<Determine and outline the frameworks and libraries that will be used\>* The frontend will be built using the React library to create a dynamic user interface for all users. The backend will use the Express.js framework to build the backend of the web app. We also will be using bcrypt to hash the passwords of our users. To allow the backend to interface with our MySQL database we will also need mysql2. |
| Security Measures | *\<Outline 4 security measures that will be implemented\>* We will use input validation and sanitisation to prevent vulnerabilities\` that may threaten our users security, this should avoid XSS and SQL injection. User passwords will be securely hashed using bcrypt. Role based access control will restrict system features, ensuring users only have access to the functionality on the website that they need and no more. |
| **Task 4.5 \- Database Integration Plan** |  |
| *\<Provide a detailed plan on how the database will be imported, populated (with sample data), connected (adapter), integrated (models), and tested within the project\>* |  |

## **Task 5 – Submit documentation for review and document feedback**

*Submit this whole document for review and seek feedback. Record feedback below and document any changes you have made to accommodate the feedback.*
